## Abstract

During **Google Summer of Code 2025**, my project focused on developing **Fate Protocol**, a decentralized perpetual prediction market operating continuously without expiration. The protocol replaces traditional order books with a **dual-vault mechanism** â€” where users trade *bullCoins* and *bearCoins* to speculate on market directions. This model enables perpetual trading, fair vault rebalancing, and fluid market participation.

The project aimed to build a scalable, transparent, and gas-efficient prediction platform, integrating multiple oracle feeds and networks. The final deliverable included both the **smart contracts** and a **Next.js 15 frontend**, fully deployed and accessible to the public.

## Project Description

### 1. Smart Contracts
The Solidity contracts form the backbone of the Fate Protocol. They implement **vault logic**, **token minting**, **fee collection**, and **price resolution** using modular oracle adapters. The architecture uses a single `IOracle` interface, allowing flexible integration with Chainlink and Hebeswap without redeploying base contracts improving long-term maintainability.

Security was ensured through OpenZeppelin contracts such as `Ownable` and `ReentrancyGuard`, and all formulas related to vault rebalancing were optimized after multiple review cycles with mentors.

### 2. Frontend Development
The frontend was built with **Next.js 15**, using a combination of **server components**, **React Query**, and **IndexedDB** caching to deliver real-time updates and offline accessibility.  
Framer Motion was used for smooth transitions, and Recharts was implemented to visualize live market data.

UI consistency and accessibility were enhanced with **shadcn/ui**, while the **RainbowKit** integration enabled multi-wallet onboarding. The application supports multiple networks through a clean, modular configuration file.

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Implemented static rendering and caching to reduce load time.  
- Used server-side props and lazy-loading for heavy components.  
- Added optimistic transaction states for seamless blockchain UX.  
- Optimized mobile layout, increasing retention.

## Challenges and Solutions

Building a perpetual prediction protocol required balancing blockchain precision with frontend responsiveness.  

### Modular Oracle Integration
One of the most complex parts was designing oracles in a way that respected contract immutability. The team implemented an **Oracle Adapter Factory**, which allowed dynamic oracle selection and avoided redeployments. This design required a deep understanding of Solidityâ€™s inheritance and factory patterns, improving overall flexibility.

### Cross-Chain Consistency
Deploying the same contracts across Ethereum, Polygon, and Ethereum Classic required careful handling of gas differences and library dependencies. I built modular Foundry scripts to streamline multi-network deployment, ensuring address consistency and ABI synchronization.

### Smart Contract Optimization
To reduce gas consumption, redundant storage writes were removed, mathematical calculations were optimized, and structs were reorganized for memory efficiency. These improvements made the protocol more cost-effective for traders.

### Frontend Data Flow
React Query and IndexedDB integration allowed for local data persistence, which significantly improved the user experience by caching portfolio data and reducing dependency on network latency.

## Key Learnings and Growth

Through GSoC, I transitioned from building small decentralized apps to architecting a full-fledged multi-network Web3 protocol.  
Working under experienced mentors gave me an invaluable perspective on **maintainable smart contract design**, **secure coding practices**, and **real-world deployment workflows**.

I also learned that open source contribution is not just about code, itâ€™s about collaboration, iteration, and continuous improvement. PR discussions and weekly review sessions taught me to approach feedback constructively, leading to cleaner, more scalable codebases.

This experience strengthened both my **technical** and **collaborative** skills and opened doors to future blockchain hackathons and advanced development opportunities.

## Future Plans

1. **Expand Fate Protocol deployment** to the **Base** and **BNB Smart Chain** mainnets for broader accessibility.  
2. **Perform extensive security audits** to ensure the robustness and reliability of all smart contracts.  
3. **Enhance analytics and insights** with advanced vault metrics and detailed performance tracking.  
4. **Upgrade the portfolio dashboard** to display comprehensive **multi-asset statistics** and cross-market positions.

## Acknowledgements

This projectâ€™s success was made possible through the constant support and guidance of my mentors â€” **Aditya Bhattad**, **Yogesh Agrawal**, and **Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo**. Their deep technical insight, detailed code reviews, and constructive feedback were instrumental in shaping both the project and my personal growth.

I also want to thank **AOSSIE** for its excellent organizational support. The weekly contributor seminars, open discussions, and mentorship sessions provided a collaborative environment where learning was both structured and enjoyable.

Participating in GSoC has been one of the most enriching experiences of my development journey â€” reinforcing my interest in blockchain and strengthening my commitment to open source.
